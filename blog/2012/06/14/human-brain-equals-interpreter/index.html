<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m reading SICP, and gaining many valuable insights into programming theory.  One thing that struck me today:<!-- more -->
When discussing the modularity of functions, the authors argue that a function &#8220;suppresses detail&#8221; about the rest of the program while performing its isolated task.</p>

<p>This idea of &#8220;suppressing&#8221; sounded wrong to me; after all, the human body is modular, but your blood doesn&#8217;t suppress your bones.  A neighborhood is modular, but a house doesn&#8217;t suppress the road.</p>

<p>I realized that I am used to thinking about programs as spatial&#8211;occupying space on a page. Instead, SICP frames the program as chronological.  Programs are designed to be read by computers, and computers do things sequentially, not spatially.</p>

<p>Modularization allows the computer to think only about what it needs <em>right now</em> to accomplish the task at hand.  You might go for a run when you return from the supermarket, but you don&#8217;t go running with the groceries in your arms.</p>

<p>This understanding of a program as a chronological sequence of actions relates back to another lesson from SICP &#8211; unlike math, every function (or &#8220;procedure&#8221;) in computer programming must be imperative, executable.  It can&#8217;t just be descriptive, illustrative.  It&#8217;s like the difference between a roadmap and a set of directions.</p>
